## Why cognitive modeling matters

Cognitive modeling helps psychology and cognitive science by making theories precise and testable. Instead of describing behavior in words alone, models spell out mechanisms in formal terms, so predictions can be checked against data. This makes it easier to test predictions with real data and compare different theories. It also connects high-level cognition ideas to possible implementations in mind and brain.
